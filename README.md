# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Classification
Iris Dataset Classification
This project demonstrates the classification of iris flowers into three species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—using the well-known Iris dataset. The classification is based on sepal and petal dimensions, showcasing the application of supervised machine learning techniques.

Project Highlights:
Data Handling and Visualization: Utilizes Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for creating informative visualizations, such as scatter plots and scatter matrices, to explore feature relationships and species distribution.

Machine Learning Models: Implements two classification algorithms:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Predicts species by examining the majority class among the nearest neighbors in the feature space.
Decision Tree Classifier: Constructs a tree-like model to segment the data based on feature thresholds.
Model Evaluation: Assesses the accuracy of both models using a dedicated testing dataset, providing insights into their performance and generalization capabilities.

Overfitting and Underfitting Analysis: Explores model performance across various configurations to identify and mitigate overfitting or underfitting issues, ensuring robust model behavior on unseen data.

Documentation and Collaboration: The code is well-documented to facilitate understanding and collaboration, making it easy for others to contribute or learn from the project.

This project serves as an educational resource for understanding machine learning concepts and workflows while providing a practical example of classification tasks. It is suitable for both beginners and those looking to deepen their knowledge in data analysis and predictive modeling.
