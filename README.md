# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Classification
Iris Dataset Classification
This project demonstrates the classification of iris flowers into three species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—using the well-known Iris dataset. The classification is based on sepal and petal dimensions, showcasing the application of supervised machine learning techniques.

Project Highlights:
Data Handling and Visualization: Utilizes Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for creating informative visualizations, such as scatter plots and scatter matrices, to explore feature relationships and species distribution.

Machine Learning Models: Implements two classification algorithms:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Predicts species by examining the majority class among the nearest neighbors in the feature space.
Decision Tree Classifier: Constructs a tree-like model to segment the data based on feature thresholds.
Model Evaluation: Assesses the accuracy of both models using a dedicated testing dataset, providing insights into their performance and generalization capabilities.

Overfitting and Underfitting Analysis: Explores model performance across various configurations to identify and mitigate overfitting or underfitting issues, ensuring robust model behavior on unseen data.

Documentation and Collaboration: The code is well-documented to facilitate understanding and collaboration, making it easy for others to contribute or learn from the project.

This project serves as an educational resource for understanding machine learning concepts and workflows while providing a practical example of classification tasks. It is suitable for both beginners and those looking to deepen their knowledge in data analysis and predictive modeling.

# Iris Flower Classification

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates how to classify iris flowers using machine learning techniques, specifically the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The script uses the famous Iris dataset, a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics.

## Description

The script performs the following steps:

1. **Data Loading:** Loads the Iris dataset using scikit-learn's `datasets.load_iris()` function.
2. **Data Exploration:** Provides a basic exploration of the dataset, including its shape, feature names, and target names.
3. **Data Visualization:** Creates a scatter matrix plot to visualize the relationships between different features of the iris flowers.
4. **Model Training:** Creates a KNN classifier and trains it using the Iris dataset.
5. **Prediction:** Uses the trained model to predict the class of a new data point.
6. **Evaluation:** Evaluates the model's performance by calculating its accuracy score.
7. **Overfitting and Underfitting:** The script demonstrates the concept of overfitting and underfitting with varying numbers of neighbors in the KNN algorithm.
8. **Decision Tree:** It includes an example of Decision Tree Classifier, fitting and predicting using the model.
